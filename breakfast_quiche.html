         <h1>Description</h1>
         <p>
            This spinach mushroom quiche is a moist vegetarian quiche perfect for any meal. 
            Feel free to add sausage if you choose. I usually make 2 large pies or several 
            small ones at one time, freezing whatever is left.        
         </p>
         <h3>Ingredients</h3>

         <h3>Steps</h3>
         <ol>
           <p><li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li></p>   
           <li>Gently combine spinach, mushrooms, onion, and feta cheese in a bowl. 
            Spread mixture into prepared pie crust; top with 1/2 of the Swiss cheese.</li>
           <p><li>Whisk eggs, milk, parsley, garlic, salt, black pepper, and nutmeg in the bowl. 
            Pour egg mixture evenly over filling, swirling egg mixture in bowl to evenly distribute seasonings.
             Top with remaining Swiss cheese, then place quiche on a baking sheet.</li></p>
           <li>Bake in the preheated oven until lightly puffed and browned, 45 to 50 minutes. 
            A toothpick inserted into the center of the filling should come out clean.
